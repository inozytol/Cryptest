# Cryptest
learning java crypto functions

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/crypto/CryptoSpec.html


This code is meant as learning toy code.

The goal was to create a class that can encrypt and decrypt streams using stream reference and password.

## Maven goals:
    mvn package - compiles sources, runs tests and creates jar from compiled classes
    mvn javadoc:javadoc - generates javadoc html files
    TODO - both of the above and copies jar to some accesible location
